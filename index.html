                    There are no “right“ or “wrong” answers to the questions on this
                    inventory. Your answers will help to show how you like to look at things and
                    how you like to go about deciding things. Knowing your own preferences and
                    learning about other people's can help you understand whether your special
                    strenghts are, what kind of work you might enjoy and be successful doing,
                    and how people with different preferences can relate to each other and be
                    valuable to society.
