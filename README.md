There are no “right“ or “wrong” answers to the questions on this
inventory. Your answers will help to show how you like to look at things and
how you like to go about deciding things. Knowing your own preferences and
learning about other people’s can help you understand whether your special
strenghts are, what kind of work you might enjoy and be successful doing,
and how people with different preferences can relate to each other and be
valuable to society.
Read each question carefully and select one of the two choices given,
which applies to you, by circling to either “A” or “B”.
